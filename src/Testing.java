 * During our work we created several superclasses , subclasses and  classes which interact with each other and can be used later on for developing a full rpg based game with such features like fighting different enemies like goblins and dragons, creating  your own build as a knight or an archer , travel through the Village and interact with npcâ€™s or go to a dungeon to find chests with loot and face different dangerous enemies. The testing was performed through implementing features of superclasses into other classes or subclasses or extending them with additional coding.
